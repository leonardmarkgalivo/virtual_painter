# virtual_painter
This project is a real-time virtual painting app that uses hand gestures to draw on the screen. With the help of MediaPipe and OpenCV, it detects finger positions to let the user select colors, change brush sizes, and draw or erase without touching the screenâ€”just by moving their hand in front of the camera.
